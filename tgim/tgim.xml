There is much consternation over the lack of walkie talkies, disagreements about whether the bad guy is an AI or a person, and some nonsense about 12 hour bass lines.  Grisha experiences pancake themed wish fulfillment and turtleneck themed dissatisfaction.  Obviously this one is for the philosophy majors out there.</description>

            <description>In this episode, Bjork and your intrepid cohosts quickly avert a Bjorkbot related disaster, then talk about the Orson Wells of Kung Fu, Sensai Steven Seagal and his latest film trailers.  He thanks us for noticing.  Then, we dive into friend of the show Werner Herzog's amazing team up with master thespian Sir Nicolas Cage to bring us a gritty re-imagining of what Street Pug might look like without all the whimsy and pink sweaters,  in a review of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.  We discuss the lizard symbolism, the lucky crack pipe, breakdancing souls, and touchdowns, not to mention new racial slurs, and one actor's ability to express nearly any emotion or concept with the phrase "Oh yeah".</description>
