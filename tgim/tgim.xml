        <description>The co-hosts get Diesel powered when they review the trailer for the upcoming XXX film, and discuss the properties of Jungle Wax.  Then, hang on to your mullets, light up a smoke and keep your blade handy, as the boys take the time gondola back to the 80's and talk about the finer points of cooling in a review of Road House, featuring the animal magnetism of Patrick Swayze and a young Sam Elliot.  Some people write in complaining that they have fallen down while wearing Björk's slippery slippers.  Björk is unrepentant. Then your heroes sequel harder when they make up sequel names, and we have the rousing conclusion to Street Pug: DA's latest mystery, in which we discover the true animal nature of Jason Statham, and witness a creator and his creation clash.</description>

        <description>Grisha and Sasha discuss Jodorowsky's Dune, a documentary about some madman who was thankfully prevented from making a 15 hour Dune film starring Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali, and Orson Welles.  We may find out what a "Jawa Punt" is, and there is much rejoicing over the fact that Donnie Yen will be doing Kung Fu on Stormtroopers.  Street Pug DA, Bjork, and Werner Herzog investigate a new mystery, and meet up with their chums, Chet and Biff, who have an interesting new hobby.</description>

        <description>Your scrappy co-hosts review the seminal film and powerful bromance Point Break.  There are many feelings, twists and turns explored.  Grisha fails to sound intelligent when he mispronounces/forgets the name Spartans actually use, the Lacedaemonians.  A Spartan fairy tale is unpacked.  Street Pug DA and Wernor Herzog travel into the world of the Hardy Boys and fight crime with Bjork.  Or do they?</description>

Then, glory abounds as a clip from the show Street Pug: DA, Attorney at Law pits Street Pug against Wernor Herzog, who has been accused of baking the towns children into a pie for his latest film.</description>

        <description>Sasha, Bjork and Grisha dive into the Rothfussverse and talk Kingkiller Chronicle theories.  Those who haven't had the pleasure of reading The Name of the Wind are advised to skip to the 25 minute mark and get the book ASAP.  The boys discuss motifs, layered storytelling and Hollywood science babble as they review the landmark film, Ninja Turtles Two: Out of the Shitter.  The mention of a badger on methamphetamine reminds our intrepid co-hosts of Redwall, and there is much rejoicing.</description>
