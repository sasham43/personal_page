        <description>Toga In The Morning returns with down-home, off-the-cuff, relaxed introduction as the boys freestyle conversation like it's the podcasting X-Games.  Then, special guest Bruce Greenhorn appears on the program to promote his terrible reductionist version of Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  The boys travel to West Hollywood to record this train wreck.</description>

        <description>The boys go for broke with their review of Now You See Me 2: The See-ening.  Is Morgan Freeman the Ruff Monster's father?  This and many other questions answered.  Then, the boys are back in town as Werner Herzog and the irrespressible Street Pug return with the thrilling conclusion of their murder mystery.  Kirk Cameron still guest-stars as Brock Nelson, PI.</description>

        <description>Don't call it post-apocalyptic as the boys review Turbo Kid (sponsored by gnome-bats, probably).  Then, the sci-fi theme continues as Werner Herzog and his ever-present muse Street Pug investigate a mystery that cuts close to home.  Kirk Cameron guest-stars as Brock Nelson, PI.</description>

        <description>The boys get Season 2 off to a bang as they review the James-Bond-inspired, Arnold-Schwarzenegger-starring, James-Cameron-directed action extravaganza that is True Lies.  They discuss the spiritual motives of the director, the changing nature of terrorism in a pre-9/11 world, and rank our favorite Pierces.  Plus, Bjork says some things!</description>

        <description>In this episode, Bjork and your intrepid cohosts quickly avert a Bjorkbot related disaster, then talk about the Orson Wells of Kung Fu, Sensai Steven Seagal and his latest film trailers.  He thanks us for noticing.  Then, we dive into friend of the show Werner Herzog's amazing team up with master thespian Sir Nicolas Cage to bring us a gritty re-imagining of what Street Pug might look like without all the whimsy and pink sweaters,  in a review of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.  We discuss the lizard symbolism, the lucky crack pipe, breakdancing souls, and touchdowns, not to mention new racial slurs, and one actor's ability to express nearly any emotion or concept with the phrase "Oh yeah".</description>

        <description>In this episode, Bjork and your intrepid co-hosts review John Woo's Face Off, in which Nicholas Cage stars as both himself and John Travolta, to the delight of all.  We discuss prison budgets, as well as their choice of entertainment, and Nic Cage's favorite kind of sandwich. Then, we return once again to the world of Street Pug: DA, as our pugnacious hero along with Wernor Herzog and Bjork go on a seemingly innocent trip to get bagels, only to discover that sponsor Tommy Muttonchops non-nefarious mustache wax might not be so non-nefarious after all.</description>

        <description>Bjork and your relatively humble co-hosts (one of them on the new "Too Many Manhattans" fad diet) review the masterpiece of cinema that is Grown Ups 2, the spiritual prequel to "Ouch My Balls". Then, we do our duty as Star Wars fans and engage in a new round of flinging theories at the wall to celebrate the release of the name of a movie.</description>

        <description>Your intrepid co-hosts kick things off with some more Diesel Power as they talk trailers and discuss Furious 8: The Fate of the Furious.  Then, differences of opinion abound when we discuss Star Wars: Rogue One and talk the necessity (or lack thereof) of Chirrut Imwe.  Darth Vader's motives are questioned, and then we segue into a rousing, swashbuckling edition of Street Pug: DA, when a mysterious amulet is delivered to the detective office, leading the boys to a museum heist, one way or the other.</description>

        <description>The co-hosts get Diesel powered when they review the trailer for the upcoming XXX film, and discuss the properties of Jungle Wax.  Then, hang on to your mullets, light up a smoke and keep your blade handy, as the boys take the time gondola back to the 80's and talk about the finer points of cooling in a review of Road House, featuring the animal magnetism of Patrick Swayze and a young Sam Elliot.  Some people write in complaining that they have fallen down while wearing Björk's slippery slippers.  Björk is unrepentant. Then your heroes sequel harder when they make up sequel names, and we have the rousing conclusion to Street Pug: DA's latest mystery, in which we discover the true animal nature of Jason Statham, and witness a creator and his creation clash.</description>

        <description>Grisha and Sasha discuss Jodorowsky's Dune, a documentary about some madman who was thankfully prevented from making a 15 hour Dune film starring Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali, and Orson Welles.  We may find out what a "Jawa Punt" is, and there is much rejoicing over the fact that Donnie Yen will be doing Kung Fu on Stormtroopers.  Street Pug DA, Bjork, and Werner Herzog investigate a new mystery, and meet up with their chums, Chet and Biff, who have an interesting new hobby.</description>

        <description>Your scrappy co-hosts review the seminal film and powerful bromance Point Break.  There are many feelings, twists and turns explored.  Grisha fails to sound intelligent when he mispronounces/forgets the name Spartans actually use, the Lacedaemonians.  A Spartan fairy tale is unpacked.  Street Pug DA and Wernor Herzog travel into the world of the Hardy Boys and fight crime with Bjork.  Or do they?</description>

This is followed by some solid investigative reporting into Snoke's origins and a slew of other topics.  Then, glory abounds as a clip from the show Street Pug: DA, Attorney at Law pits Street Pug against Wernor Herzog, who has been accused of baking the towns children into a pie for his latest film.</description>

Those who haven't had the pleasure of reading The Name of the Wind are advised to skip to the 25 minute mark and get the book ASAP.  The boys discuss motifs, layered storytelling and Hollywood science babble as they review the landmark film, Ninja Turtles Two: Out of the Shitter.  The mention of a badger on methamphetamine reminds our intrepid co-hosts of Redwall, and there is much rejoicing.</description>
